#Waveform Live Wallpaper
A very simple animated wallpaper based off of SoundCloud waveforms.

The idea is straightforward - it picks a random artist (from a fixed list right now), and downloads a track listing. Every 15 seconds or so, a new track is selected and downloaded.  It's then animated by a series of slowly scrolling bars.  After 15 minutes or so, a new artist is chosen.

The bars are designed to be simple, fairly resource-light, and pretty. If you don't have internet, it'll simply cycle through cached waveforms until it finds internet again.
